## Clowns

Clowns they lure me to the circus for a night of fun  
Lights and candy, sweet and dandy  
Laughter has begun  
I hear them calling  
I feel them creeping  
I think they're coming for my skin  
I hear them calling  
They're creeping  
The clowns are closing in

Smiles sparkle in their eyes  
Malice or madness, can't decide  
I hear them calling  
I feel them creeping  
They're clawing at my skin  
I hear them calling  
The creeping  
The clowns are closing in  
Clowns have trapped me in the circus, oh boy here they come

All of you are calling me  
All of you are feasting on me  
All of you are calling me  
All of you are feasting on me  
I hear them calling  
I feel them creeping  
They're clawing at my skin  
I hear them calling  
I feel them creeping  
The clowns are closing in  
I hear them calling  
I feel them creeping  
The clowns are closing in  
Clowns have lured me to the circus  
This oughta be fun

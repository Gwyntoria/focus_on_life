# Second Adolescence

## Two Shoes' Tissues

Two-shoes' tissues litter the floor
She doesn't want to behave anymore
Her heart's so weary from being sore
The tears she cried have long gone dry
She ran out of water so she used wine
To fill that void that creeps into her sleep at night
She's a doe-eyed girl in a cruel, cruel world
Clinging to what she believes in
Though her innocence makes her light shine bright,
It's something that no one believes in
She sees the world as it is, how it should be
Aches in her belief in how it could be
They say she's weak because she's kind
So soft spoken, such a feeble mind
There's so much she can't handle, she's our little angel
She mustn't be worth noticing, she never demands anything
Must be naive and out of touch, she never really says much
Because she sees the world and all it's lies
So she cowers and she hides
Only wants to do right by the people in her life
She sees the world as it is, how it should be
Aches in her belief in how it could be
She's been living within these walls
She has not been living at all
Letting fear and worry rule her heart,
keep her captive in the cave, keep her in the dark
She sees the corruption, she sees the blind,
how the crippled walk, the deaf don't pay mind
They can't seem to hear a word, don't listen, closed off to the world
She sees the world as it is, how it should be
Aches in her belief in how it could be
Doe-eyed girl in a cruel, cruel world
Clinging to what she believes in
Though she knows a truth, no one will know she knows 'til she's ripped from it
Going unnoticed, underestimated, under the radar, unappreciated,
Over their heads, and deep inside they think she's odd because she's wise
Two shoe's doesn't want to cry anymore
She cleans all her tissues up off the floor
She'll bend your rules then show you what she's living for

## Cool

I wanna be in with the in crowd
I wanna be down with the low down
I wanna be deemed prima donna supreme
I wanna be the best thing you've ever seen
You can mold yourself into anything you want
Wanna be the superstar, wanna be the debutante
Wanna be the ingenue, it's all about you, you, you
It's gonna be
All about me
Get ready watch me cuz I'm no longer who I was
I just wanna be cool, so I'll be just like you
Roll with the punches, do like you do
I just wanna be cool, I'm just like you
So why shouldn't I be, Why won't I be cool too
(Cool, Cool, Cool)
I'll laugh at your jokes, make the same faces
Wear the same clothes, be in your good graces
You'll fall in love with me so madly deeply
Pretty soon you'll all want to be me
If only you knew it was this easy
Schmoozin' boozin', easy peasy
Popularity is Hilarity
But it's still what I need
It's gonna be
All about me
Get ready watch me cuz I'm no longer who I was
I just wanna be cool, so I'll be just like you
Roll with the punches, do like you do
I just wanna be cool, I'm just like you
So why shouldn't I be, Why won't I be cool too
(Cool, Cool, Cool)
I'll ape you and you ape me
Survival of the fittest, More like similarity
I'll ape you and you ape me
Survival comes down to similarity
It's gonna be
All about me
Get ready watch me cuz I'm no longer who I was
I just wanna be cool, so I'll be just like you
Roll with the punches, do like you do
I just wanna be cool, I'm just like you
So why shouldn't I be, Why won't I be cool
I'm gonna be, I have to be (Cool)
I'm gonna be, I have to be (Cool)
I'm gonna be, I have to be,
I have to be (Cool)
(Cool)
I'm gonna be cooler than you

## Popular Girls

Always looking over my shoulder
Competing for which of us can be colder
A calloused mind with beautified hair to hide its frame
Everyday I put my face on, the brightest smile, I have the fake one
I know it's flawed but that's just how it goes oh oh oh
I'm a popular girl, I know how this works
Giving the cold shoulder always has its perks
Frenemies, you and me, best in show
Fake it till you make it no one will know
Glam and fame, celebrity, your longing is our luxury
The calamity of emptiness is worth it when you want me
Being popular is ocular, a visual practice, not more than an act it's
Delectable spectacle, your longing anguish is what makes us famous
We're top notch, you're bottom shelf
Our heaven makes your life hell
Who we are, and what we do, is selective don't include you cuz
We're popular girls (We're Popular)
Popular girls
We have a rep to protect, image to maintain,
Keep it lush, keep it plush, keep it hollow and vain
We can't just let anyone in we want
After all, your insignificance is what makes us important
You either hate us with jealousy or want to be us openly
Brand names, designer clothes, svelte frames, turned up nose
Walk tall, have it all, blown out hair- so beautiful it's just not fair
Being popular is ocular, a visual practice, not more than an act it's
Delectable spectacle, your longing anguish is what makes us famous
We're top notch, you're bottom shelf
Our heaven makes your life hell
Who we are, and what we do, is selective don't include you cuz
We're popular girls (We're Popular)
Popular girls
We eat the likes of you for breakfast, scrumptious and delicious
It's a pick me up to pluck you up and tear you up, tear you to pieces
Give us all this power, we're sweet but we act sour
Gotta keep it dour, popular is power
Being popular is ocular, a visual practice, not more than an act it's
Delectable spectacle, your longing anguish is what makes us famous
We're top notch, you're bottom shelf
Our heaven makes your life hell
Who we are, and what we do, is selective don't include you cuz
We're popular girls (We're Popular)
Popular girls
Popular Popular Popular Popular

## Hot 4 Teacher

I see you creep (Uh), see you creep (Uh) with them peep (Uh)s
8 am sharp in the morning and you're wearing that same clip-on
I can't believe how overworked and underpaid you must feel
Mr. Martyr Underdog Overachiever here
Can't you see, I got a crush
(Gotta relieve all that stress somehow)
I may be young but it don't stop the blush
Five days a week, I get all flushed
(No time for dating and you're here now)
Now everyone deserves a break, let's make some blood rush
Teach me, teach me hot Mr. Teacher
My grades keep on dropping and I'm coming up with fever
Tell me why I'm struggling, this overachiever
Teach me teacher preacher teach me why I'm hot for teacher
We're in the all-stars, I'll be your wide-receiver
Gotsta take one to know one till you're a true believer
I'll make you see my love for you is true
It can't be dangerous, it's just a tad bit scandalous
I may be fragile, but I'm crushed
(With no time for yourself, and the coast clear)
I may be young, but it don't stop the blush
Five days a week, I get all flushed
(Why starve for meat when the prime's right here)
Eventually you need a break, let's make some blood rush
Teach me, teach me hot Mr. Teacher
My grades keep on dropping and I'm coming up with fever
Tell me why I'm struggling, this overachiever
Teach me teacher preacher teach me why I'm hot for teacher
Teach what you preach, you gotta preach what you teach
Teach what you preach, you gotta preach what you teach
Teach me, Teacher Preacher
Teach me, Teacher Preacher
Teach me, teach me hot Mr. Teacher
My grades keep on dropping and I'm coming up with fever
Tell me why I'm struggling, this overachiever
Teach me teacher preacher teach me why I'm hot for teacher
Teach me teacher preacher teach me why I'm hot for teacher

## Boys "R" Us

Boy Toy Mannequin
Wind me up, wind me up I'll reel you in
Cracker Jack's King and Jack's in his box
Has me spinning circles till I pop his top off
Jack's got his marbles all in a bunch
Objectify me, oh won't you hun
I'm just a doll who loves you much
I'm just your little play thing huh
(Boys R Toys) Toys with your heart and he doesn't know
(Boys R Toys) When you toy it just goes to show
(Boys R Toys) Well what's a toy to do all day but to have fun and play the game?
All fun and games till one gets played
Don't love the player, love the game
Turn the tables then you're safe
When your love's out of luck take a trip to Boys"R"Us
Love, Hate, Pick a Mate
He chooses who he wants based off his check list made
Even if he loves you it won't be long
Jack loses his marbles the second he's on
Love me and leave me, oh won't you please
The physical is all I need
I understand you're too weak hun
So it's just sweet and tasty plain old fun
(Boys R Toys) Toys with your heart and he doesn't know
(Boys R Toys) When you toy it just goes to show
(Boys R Toys) Well what's a toy to do all day but to have fun and play the game?
All fun and games till one gets played
Don't love the player, love the game
Turn the tables then you're safe
When your love's hit the rocks take a trip to Boys"R"Us
All he does is toy and play- well, what's a toy to do all day?
What else would you expect from Jack? Work makes Jack a dull boy
What else would you expect from Jack? Love makes Jack a scared boy
He likes his heart made of stone
It keeps him cool, best off alone
Even if he loves you it won't be long
Jack loses his marbles the second he's on
Turn the tables then you're safe
From blood and carnage and disgrace
(Boys R Toys) Toys with your heart and he doesn't know
(Boys R Toys) When you toy it just goes to show
(Boys R Toys) Well what's a toy to do all day but to have fun and play the game?
All fun and games till one gets played
Don't love the player, love the game
Turn the tables then you're safe
When your love's hit a slump take a trip to Boys"R"Us.
Pac Man (Boys R Us)
What a man (Boys R Us)
Show me what you're packin' (Boys R Us)

## Gamer Boy

I'm losing who I am at your expense
Anytime I try to talk you're like, "Hold up, 5 minutes"
It seems like I'm waiting on hand and foot
Just getting you to look away does no good
Controllers control you
Consoles own you
World of Warcraft gives me the shaft
"Lok'tar", There you are
All is fair in love and war
You're more in love with a humanoid orc
Anytime we start to fight you scream, "I do it 'for the horde'"
With you, it's all RPGs and Strategy
All you care about's your Dynasty
Gamer Boy ain't got no time for me
Gamer Boy says I'm the one he needs
Yeah, along with his PS3, Final Fantasy, Starcraft, Halo, and Call of Duty
Yeah, I'm a real priority- a Gamer Boy indeed
Anytime we set a date you're always late
I'm already ready hun that's what you say
I clean up after you because you're lost in the game
You totally forget the mess your body's made
But you have to collect and increase in rank
It's always them blue shells to blame
Hadouken Shoryuken gotta keep it movin'
Escape responsibility through virtual reality
Shoot em up while you shoot me down
Why even keep me around
You want me to stay and cheer you on
And if I don't then it becomes
Terran Zerg Protoss, you must construct
Additional pylons- Hold the fort
See, you're Grandmaster in the game but you're Bronze with me
And I'm done with losing out, that's game- GG
Gamer Boy ain't got no time for me
Gamer Boy says I'm the one he needs
Yeah, along with his PS3, Final Fantasy, Starcraft, Halo, and Call of Duty
Yeah, I'm a real priority- a Gamer Boy indeed
Command and Conquer- Peace through Power
Show me your Diablo- baby where do you go
Take me through this nightmare then drag me down to hell
I need someone who'll grow with me, This time has served me well
Oh, so you've been with
Princess Peach, Zelda, Ruto, Midna, Hilda, Daisy
DK, Pokemon, Sonic, Starfox, MARIO KART
Thank you Mario, but this princess is in another castle
Gamer Boy ain't got no time for me
Gamer Boy says I'm the one he needs
Yeah along with his PS3, Nintendo Wii, Xbox console and his PC
Yeah, I'm a real priority- a Gamer Boy indeed

## Prom Queen

I am not my skin, this body that I'm in betrays who I am
Think what you will of me, you judge who I can be on pigment and collagen
Rate how supple is my pride, how robust is my backside
Won't succumb to every prick and prong maneuver that you run by me
Remember that I'm strong- just cuz I cry don't mean I'm wrong
Just means I care and I'm frustrated all my pores are dilated
I'll never be prom queen
I'll never join the pageantry
I'll never wave my hand with a grace akin to mannequins
I'll never be prom queen
I'm just not fit for flattery
I'll never parade or masquerade for what you deem is perfection
So go on rate the volume of my lips, how fem I am based on my hips
How kind I am based on my smile- never mind a tact called guile
You judge competence on gait, how fit I am based on my weight
My insight on my faith, oh you're so intu just you wait
You let age determine youth, base beauty on physical attributes
Well aren't you in for a deception, it's not more than presentation and that's why
I'll never be prom queen
I'll never join the pageantry
I'll never wave my hand with a grace akin to mannequins
I'll never be prom queen
I'm just not fit for flattery
I'll never parade or masquerade for what you deem is perfection
Just like the little kid inside me said, I'll see it to the end
Put your back into it- get right to it- you'll come out ahead
Say I'm too old to act so young
What do you expect from slapping tongue
I set myself to an endeavor, I'll get by because I'm clever
I don't need your damn tiara to know the worth of my persona
I'll never be prom queen
I'll never join the pageantry
I'll never wave my hand with a grace akin to mannequins
I'll never be prom queen
I'm just not fit for flattery
I'll never parade or masquerade for what you deem is perfection
I'll dance with my teeth in my hands, my eyes in my head
I'll smile at you while I cry tears inside wishing I was dead
All this sells my beauty and my smarts
Never mind what's in my heart
You're all mad, simply silly
Make these dresses nice and frilly

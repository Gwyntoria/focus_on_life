# The Dark

You can't control where you came from
But you can control where you're going
My life's been spent in the shadows
My heart's never been one for burning up the night (BRIGHT)
Allowing me to do
Now I'm speaking up, Coming out of the dark
I feel it in my lungs, that air that you breathe
I'm no longer numb, I feel it in my thumbs
There's a light in my eyes and now I see
Toxic friends, dent your head, knock em off in the end
Can't change your family but don't worry you'll make peace in the end
You can lose yourself in the ember, there won't be much to remember
You can leave your head in the gutter or rekindle the spark that you harbor
But you better shut up and show em, or there'll be hell to pay
Now I'm speaking up, Coming out of the dark
I feel it in my lungs, that air that you breathe
I'm no longer numb, I feel it in my thumbs
There's a light in my eyes and now I see
The weight's off my shoulders, the winter's are warmer
I'm no longer cornered, my heart's not sore and
I'm no longer insecure and my skin feels sure
And I can't believe this is how it's always meant to be
Remain, You can stay in the dark, but you'll go blind
And the demons that lurk won't ever let it die
They'll eat you alive
And I can't believe, Finally
I'm speaking up, Coming out of the dark
I feel it in my lungs, that air that you breathe
I'm no longer numb, I feel it in my thumbs
There's a light in my eyes and now I see
Coming out of the dark
Coming out of the dark
Finally
Now I'm speaking up, coming out of the dark
I feel it in my lungs, that air that you breathe
I'm no longer numb, I feel it in my thumbs
There's a light in my eyes and now I see
The weight's off my shoulders, the winter's are warmer
I'm no longer cornered, my heart's not sore and
I'm no longer insecure and my skin feels sure
And I can't believe this is how it's always meant to be

## St. James Infirmary

I went down to St. James Infirmary  
And I saw my baby there  
She was stretched out on a long, white table  
So cold, so sweet, so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her  
Wherever she may be
She can look this whole wide world over  
But she'll never find sweet man like me

When I die, bury me in straight-lace shoes  
I want a parasol and a Stetson hat  
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain  
So the boys'll know that I died standin' pat.

I went down to St. James Infirmary  
And I saw my baby there  
She was stretched out on a long, white table  
So cold, so sweet, and so fair
